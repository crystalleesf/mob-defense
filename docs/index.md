## Summary
Mob Defense is an agent trained to attack and fend off zombies. The agent is placed in a closed arena with grass for walls mixed with a handful of glowstone blocks to brighten the arena. The agent is also provided with one enchanted diamond sword to protect itself against the three zombies in the arena. Our agent's goal is to kill all three of the zombies without incurring damage to health or dying.
